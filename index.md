**_Riksdagen_ (The Parliament) is an custom AI that generates photorealistic portraits of Swedish members of parliament. It is a custom machine learning model trained on about 1400 press photos of all Swedish members of parliament from 1992-2022.**

The process has imprinted the model with detailed visual information on the faces of power in Sweden during this period. As the generated images of the machine are based on properties it has learnt from the material, the output becomes a statistically accurate representation, prediction and reflection on who we choose to govern us, as well as a comment on algorithmic self-reproduction of power in politics.


### Physical outcomes

The work is intended to be shown as a series of 349 framed portraits on a wall, placed in the same formation as the seating in the Swedish parliament chamber [*plenisalen*](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/sa-funkar-riksdagen/arbetet-i-riksdagen/vad-ar-vad-i-kammaren/). In front of the wall, a screen showing a latent walk video of generated parliament members turning into new parliament members.

*Riksdagen (the Parliament)* was showed at the AI art exhibition [Sentient Machines? in August 2022 at Färgfabriken](https://fargfabriken.se/en/pa-gang/sentient-machines/), which was part of the [Futureless Festival for Tachnology and the Arts](https://www.futurelessfestival.com/) with support från [Kulturrådet (Swedish Arts Council)](https://www.kulturradet.se/) and [Nordisk Kulturfond (Nordic Culture Fund)](https://www.nordiskkulturfond.org/en), curated by [Paola Torres Núñez del Prado](https://autodios.github.io/).

*Output from Riksdagen.*

The work has also been published as a book with a print run of 100 copies, documenting the 349 generated members of parliament. Contact me if you are interested in getting the book.
